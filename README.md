# Why Prompt Tuning is Needed
Main Points of Prompt Tuning
Prompt tuning is a specialized technique used to adapt pre-trained language models for specific tasks without modifying the entire model. Instead of retraining all the parameters of a large model, prompt tuning optimizes a much smaller set of learnable parameters, called "soft prompts," which are prepended to the input data. This offers several key advantages:

Resource Efficiency: Only a small number of prompt parameters are trained while the core model remains frozen, dramatically reducing computational costs and energy consumption compared to full fine-tuning.

Rapid Deployment: Prompt tuning enables fast adaptation of large models to new tasks without the lengthy process of retraining, facilitating quicker experimentation and deployment.

Preservation of Model Integrity: Since the original model weights are untouched, the pre-trained knowledge and generalization abilities of the model are preserved.

Task Flexibility: The same foundational model can be used for multiple tasks by simply changing the prompts, eliminating the need to maintain multiple different fine-tuned models.

Reduced Human Effort: It automates finding the best task-specific prompts, lessening the need for manual prompt engineering, which can be prone to error and time-consuming.

Competitive Performance: Especially for large models, prompt tuning can reach performance levels comparable to traditional fine-tuning methods.

Example of Prompt Tuning
Consider a large pre-trained language model tasked with sentiment analysis, classifying whether a sentence's sentiment is positive or negative.

Instead of fine-tuning all model parameters, prompt tuning adds a set of learnable soft prompts to the beginning of the input sentence.

For the input text: "The movie was fantastic," a soft prompt is prepended that helps the model focus on sentiment classification.

During training, only the soft prompt parameters are updated based on the model's output relative to the true sentiment label (e.g., "positive").

This approach effectively guides the frozen large model to perform sentiment classification without massive retraining.
